# Disclaimer
For convenience, dependencies have been vendored: node_modules directory commited to the repository

Though for real-life case it is not recommended, there would be additional step to install dependencies first:

`yarn install`

# Dependencies`
- nodejs
- yarn

# Running tests

| command | description |
|---|---|
|`yarn test`|Launch all tests|
|`yarn test --spec src/tests/FILE.js`|Launch specific tests set|
